## Introduction
The Weather App is a Python project that allows users to retrieve and visualize weather forecast data for a specific location. Users can input the desired place, the number of forecast days, and select the type of data visualization they prefer. The app then accesses a weather API to fetch the necessary data and presents it in the form of graphs or images, providing users with an intuitive and informative way to understand the weather trends.

## Features
**Place Input**: Users can provide the name of the place (city or location) for which they want to receive weather forecasts.

**Forecast Days**: Users can specify the number of days into the future for which they want to retrieve weather forecasts.

**Data Visualization**: Users have the option to choose between different types of data visualizations:

**Graphs**: The app can generate line graphs or bar charts to display temperature, precipitation, or other weather-related metrics over the selected forecast days.

**Images**: Users can choose to receive visual representations of weather data, such as heatmaps showcasing temperature variations.
